Hello,

My name is Gram Abdellah and I’m applying for the {JOB_TITLE} opening at {COMPANY_NAME}. In a recent municipal parks contract I maintained multiple parks (mowing, edging, litter control) and supported a planting program that noticeably improved curb appeal. That role taught me to prioritize tasks by impact ,  focusing on safety, accessibility, and visible results.

I am currently based in Casablanca, Morocco, and open to relocation for the right opportunity. I work well in small crews and communicate clearly with supervisors and residents. I’d welcome the chance to bring the same practical improvements to your sites. my résumé and cover letter are attached for your review.

Best regards,
