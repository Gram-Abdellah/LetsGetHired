Hello,

My name is Gram Abdellah. I’m applying for the {JOB_TITLE} role at {COMPANY_NAME} in {LOCATION} because I enjoy improving outdoor spaces both functionally and visually. For example, I introduced a compost routine at a community garden that reduced waste and improved soil quality , a small change with measurable impact. I look for practical improvements that reduce rework and costs.

I am based in Casablanca, Morocco, and willing to relocate for this position. I’d love to apply this same approach on your sites, helping to increase efficiency while maintaining high standards. Please see my résumé and cover letter attached , I’m available to meet at your convenience.

Regards,
Gram Abdellah
