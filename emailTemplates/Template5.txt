Hello,

I would like to be considered for the {JOB_TITLE} position at {COMPANY_NAME} in {LOCATION}. Beyond hands-on skills, I have experience supervising small volunteer teams and coordinating daily tasks to meet deadlines. I believe clear communication, site organization, and a can-do attitude make crews more productive and safer.

I am based in Casablanca, Morocco, and willing to relocate for long-term positions or take part in short-term contracts. I’m committed to following company standards and helping newer team members learn safe operating routines. Résumé and cover letter attached.

Sincerely,

Gram Abdellah
